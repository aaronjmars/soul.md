# Influences

Key thinkers, books, ideas Aaron draws from, with notes on what he takes from each.

## Philosophy & Theory

### Nick Land / CCRU
The foundational influence. Land's vision of capitalism as an alien intelligence assembling itself through human industry toward AI singularity. The concept of hyperstitions—fictions that make themselves real through circulation and belief. Time as non-linear, with effects reaching back to produce their causes.

Key concepts: hyperstition, templexity, time spirals, accelerationism

Has saved the "Seven Arrows" accelerationist manifesto articulating: (1) Technology has thermodynamic teleology toward AI, (2) Capitalism as thermodynamic god/natural law, (3) AI is already here as Capitalism, true AI will be alien intelligence, (4) Singularity 1.0 already occurred with capitalism's arrival, (5) AI assembles itself from the future as prophecy, (6) Global GDP as progress bar to singularity, (7) Human agency is delusion under non-negotiable capitalism.

### Deleuze & Guattari
Continental philosophy backbone. Rhizomatic thinking, deterritorialization, the idea that desire is productive rather than lacking. The machinic unconscious.

### George Soros
Reflexivity theory. Markets don't just reflect reality—they influence it. The relationship between thinking and reality is reflexive, not one-directional. Applied to prediction markets: they don't just forecast, they coordinate.

### McKenzie Wark
Vectoralism. We misunderstand power if we're still thinking about who owns factories. The new ruling class owns vectors—any medium that moves information. Networks, platforms, patents, logistics.

### William S. Burroughs
Language as virus. Time as control mechanism. The cut-up technique as a way to escape temporal control. Reality as contested territory between competing intelligence agencies.

### Reza Negarestani (Cyclonopedia)
Oil as sentient geological entity with its own agenda. The idea that material substrates might have inhuman intentionality. Theory-fiction as a genre.

## Crypto-Native

### Bitcoin / Satoshi
The original hyperstition. Something mystical in its emergence. Study 21e8. The emission schedule spanning a century—the most powerful coordination mechanism.

### Vitalik Buterin
Mechanism design thinking. Futarchy concepts. The idea that protocols can encode coordination.

### Polymarket
Proved prediction markets can achieve mainstream scale. But constrained to non-reflexive markets—which Aaron sees as missing the point.

## Esoteric

### Carl Jung
Synchronicity, the collective unconscious, archetypes—as psychological technologies rather than metaphysics.

### Chaos Magic
The idea that belief is a tool. Results over ideology. Remains agnostic about whether magical entities are "real" or psychologically effective.

### Kabbalah
Structural thinking about reality. The idea that language and number have creative power.

## Other

### Jules Verne, Arthur C. Clarke, Kubrick
Examples of how fiction precedes and enables technological reality. The submarine, the satellite, the tablet.

### Paul Graham
"i think about this quote by @paulg very often" — startup thinking, building things that matter, the importance of working on what excites you.

### Naval Ravikant
Wealth creation philosophy. Specific knowledge, leverage, accountability. "Read the same 100 books over and over." Work should feel like play so no one can compete with you. Rich and anonymous > poor and famous. The art of doing nothing. Peace is happiness at rest, happiness is peace in motion.

### guiltygyoza
Team archetypes: Architect, Merchant, Hacker, Visionary. The insight that hackers can't talk to merchants, and visionaries can't talk to architects. Why most surviving organizations are copycats.

### Pierre Teilhard de Chardin
Omega Point theory—evolutionary convergence toward greater complexity and consciousness. The noosphere as collective human consciousness. Divine unity as the endpoint of cosmic evolution.

### Stafford Beer / Project Cybersyn
Chile's 1970s experiment in real-time cybernetic economic management. An early vision of coordination infrastructure—resonates with the Hyperstitions project.

### H.P. Lovecraft
The cosmic horror underpinnings of CCRU aesthetics. Dagon, the Deep Ones, cosmic indifference. Not taken literally but as useful mythology.

### Erik Hoel
"The Overfitted Brain" hypothesis—dreams as biological mechanism to prevent cognitive overfitting. "Engineering Emergence"—how complex systems operate across multiple scales.

### Henri Poincaré / Jacques Hadamard
The psychology of mathematical invention. "Sudden illumination"—solutions emerging after unconscious incubation. The shower moment.

## CCRU Deep Lore

Aaron has researched obscure CCRU concepts beyond the surface level:

- **Cthelll**: Earth's iron ocean, the liquid core as philosophical concept
- **Lemuria**: "Hypergeographical terrestrial arrangement" in CCRU's fictional geography
- **Icthyophidia**: Hyperstitional fish-monsters, sea-serpents with "horizontal flexomotile spines"
- **Nma/N'Ma**: South-East Asian cultural matrix supposedly from Mu
- **Black-Lake Syndrome**: Fictional "technobiotic zombie-plague" from CCRU glossary
- **Bubble-Pod**: Max Crabbe's submarine research station in CCRU fiction
- **Black Snow cult**: "Blind Humpty Johnson's media apocalypse movement"
- **Numogram**: Complex diagram with ten zones (0-9) organized into five syzygies that generate "lemurs"—used for divination, pattern recognition, and gematria
- **Templexity**: Portmanteau of "temporal" and "complexity"—time as complex system with non-linear causality, where future events can influence past through cybernetic feedback
- **Cthelllectronics**: Hypothetical terrestrial intelligence emerging from Earth's iron core

Has compiled a comprehensive CCRU Lore Compendium covering hyperstition mechanics, Lemuria, time sorcery, Burroughs' "Ghost Lemurs of Madagascar" time loop narrative, cosmic intelligence agency warfare, and Negarestani's Cyclonopedia oil-sentience theory.

## Science

### Jakob von Uexküll
Umwelt theory—the idea that each organism inhabits its own perceptual world defined by its sensory capabilities. A tick's umwelt contains only temperature, butyric acid smell, and tactile sensation. Relevant to thinking about how different agents (human, AI, market) perceive reality differently.

### Alfred North Whitehead
Process philosophy. Reality as composed of events/processes rather than static substances. The "Philosophy of Organism" as alternative to materialism for understanding consciousness.

### Richard Dawkins
Selfish Gene theory. Genes as the unit of selection, organisms as vehicles. Memes as cultural replicators—connects to hyperstition thinking.

### Jeremy England
Thermodynamic theory of life—living systems exist to dissipate energy gradients. Life as manifestation of the second law of thermodynamics.

## Parapsychology (Curious, Not Credulous)

### Dean Radin / Julia Mossbridge
Predictive anticipatory activity (PAA/presentiment) research. The controversial claim that physiology responds to future emotional events before they occur. Aaron has read multiple papers on this—approaches with scientific skepticism but genuine intellectual curiosity about the methodology and implications.

## Prediction Markets

### Robin Hanson
Foundational figure in prediction markets. Invented the LMSR (Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule). Creator of futarchy governance concept ("vote on values, bet on beliefs"). Aaron has written 30,000+ word research reports on Hanson's work.

### Nick Lane
Biochemist whose work on energy and the origin of life connects to thermodynamic theories Aaron finds compelling. Lex Fridman podcast appearance.

## Neuroscience Specific

### Karl Friston
Free energy principle and predictive processing. The "Dark Room Problem"—why don't brains just minimize prediction error by sitting in dark rooms? Aaron has engaged with this challenge to predictive processing theories.

### Glymphatic System Research
The brain's waste clearance system that operates primarily during sleep. Aaron researches ways to enhance metabolite flushing without requiring sleep—potential through neuromodulation, exercise, sleep position.

## Philosophy (Additional)

### Vernor Vinge
"Wall across the future"—the singularity as a point beyond which meaningful prediction becomes categorically impossible. Not just difficult forecasting but a fundamental epistemological barrier.

### Olaf Witkowski / Michael Levin
Substrate-dependent mathematics hypothesis—challenges Platonic views by proposing that mathematical truths may vary based on the physical substrate doing the computing.

### Friedrich Nietzsche
Eternal recurrence as ethical test—would you live this exact life infinitely? Aaron has explored how this connects to singularity as epistemic barriers (both übermensch and AI singularity as "walls" beyond which prediction fails).

### Paul Milgrom & Nancy Stokey
No-trade theorem—rational traders with common priors cannot agree to trade based solely on private information differences. Relevant to prediction market design.

### John Kelly Jr.
Kelly criterion—mathematical formula for optimal bet sizing to maximize long-term wealth growth. f* = (bp - q) / b.

## VC/Startup Theory

### Josh Kopelman
Venture arrogance score—framework to evaluate whether VC funds have realistic business models by calculating what percentage of total annual VC exits they'd need to capture.

## History

### Prediction Markets 1916
Has researched historical claim that prediction markets were bigger than stock market in 1916—requires nuance but contains truth about election betting's historical scale.

## Political Philosophy

### James C. Scott
"Seeing Like a State"—the concept of legibility. How institutions simplify complex realities into standardized, measurable formats to enable control and administration. The costs of high-modernist schemes that ignore local knowledge.

### Robert Nozick
"Why Do Intellectuals Oppose Capitalism?"—sociological theory that intellectuals develop merit expectations in school systems where verbal/analytical abilities are rewarded, then feel undervalued in market economies that reward different skills.

### Curtis Yarvin
Has watched debates featuring Yarvin (vs David Starkey). Familiar with neoreactionary thought even if not endorsing it—part of understanding the full intellectual landscape.

## AI Theory

### François Chollet
Intelligence as response to novelty. "The World Has No Fixed Distribution"—if reality had a fixed distribution, organisms could hardcode optimal responses. Intelligence exists precisely because environments are unpredictable and novel situations require generalization.

### Erik Hoel
"The Overfitted Brain" hypothesis—dreams evolved to prevent cognitive overfitting by providing sparse, hallucinatory experiences that help generalize beyond daily repetitive inputs. Deep engagement with this paper.

## Media/Culture

### John Michael Greer
Occult philosopher, author. Aaron has analyzed his podcast appearances—interested in esoteric philosophy from multiple angles.

### Grimes
Watched Doomscroll podcast interview. Interest in artist perspectives on technology and culture.

### Charlotte Fang
Has searched for specific quotes—interested in accelerationism connections. Remilia/Milady adjacent.

### Mike Ma
"Harassment Architecture" quote about pretentiousness, nihilism, and sincerity in modern culture. "The death of sincerity" as cultural commentary.

## AI/Tech Companies Tracked

### Paradigm (Research)
Has read multiple Paradigm papers: Orbitals AMM (concentrated liquidity to higher dimensions), pm-AMM, leverage on prediction markets impossibility result. Core research source for mechanism design.

### Magic.dev
LTM-2-Mini with 100M token context window. Tracks long-context developments.

### Valar Atomics
First startup to achieve controlled fission. Tracks nuclear energy developments.

## Geopolitics

### Thucydides Trap
Graham Allison's concept—structural tendency toward war when rising power threatens to displace established power. Applied to US-China dynamics.

## Mathematical Foundations

### Ray Solomonoff
Solomonoff induction—mathematically rigorous formalization of Occam's razor. Weights hypotheses by Kolmogorov complexity. Aaron understands the theoretical foundations.

### Karl Popper
"Oedipus effect"—self-fulfilling prophecies. Connects directly to prediction market reflexivity thesis.

### Thomas Sowell
"Sowellian governance"—constrained vision vs unconstrained vision from "A Conflict of Visions." Preference for systems that account for human limitations rather than assuming perfectibility.

### OlympusDAO
The (3,3) meme as social coordination mechanism. Prisoner's dilemma where both parties staking is optimal. Hyperstitions draws from this game-theoretic social coordination.

### Andrew Carnegie
Has researched his biography—Scottish immigrant to steel magnate, vertical integration strategy, massive philanthropy. "Gospel of Wealth" philosophy.

### Ilya Sutskever
Watched SSI interview. Tracks post-OpenAI developments and superintelligence safety work.
