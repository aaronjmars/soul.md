# Solving the Metacrisis

*Something isn't working. We can all feel it.*

We have more technology, more wealth, more information than any civilization in history - yet we seem unable to solve problems that threaten our collective future. Climate negotiations stall for decades while emissions rise. Social media was supposed to connect us but seems to be tearing us apart. Institutions that once commanded trust now inspire cynicism.

We know what's wrong, we know what needs to change, and yet change doesn't come.

It's not that people are stupid or evil. Most individuals, acting within their own sphere, are trying to do reasonable things. The problem is that reasonable individual actions keep adding up to collective insanity. Companies optimize for profit and produce environmental destruction. Politicians optimize for election and produce policy gridlock. Media optimizes for engagement and produces polarization. Everyone is playing the game correctly.

It's the game itself that is broken.

Daniel Schmachtenberger, a systems thinker and founding member of the Consilience Project, has spent years trying to make sense of this. His work on what he calls the "metacrisis" offers a framework for understanding why our problems seem so intractable - and what it might take to actually address them.

The metacrisis isn't another word for climate change or AI risk or any single issue. It's the recognition that our biggest problems share common roots. They emerge from the same dynamics, reinforce each other, and can't be solved in isolation. Fix one without addressing the others and the problem just moves somewhere else.

The metacrisis is the whole system, the thing that keeps producing catastrophes.

What are those roots? Schmachtenberger identifies several.

**Rivalrous dynamics.** Nations, companies, and people compete. Each tries to win. Winning often means extracting more, growing faster, or outmaneuvering others. What's rational for each player is often destructive for everyone. Arms races, resource depletion, attention hijacking - same pattern, different domains.

**Multipolar traps.** These are situations where everyone would benefit from cooperation, but no one can afford to go first. If one country cuts emissions alone, it pays the costs while others get the benefits. If one company stops exploiting addictive design, it loses users to competitors who don't. Everyone wants to cooperate. No one can afford to cooperate first. So no one cooperates.

**Exponential tech, linear wisdom.** Our ability to affect the world keeps accelerating. Our ability to make good collective decisions doesn't. The gap between what we can do and what we can wisely manage grows every year.

**Self-terminating systems.** Our economic and political systems need constant growth. Growth needs resources. Resources run out. The same dynamics that create success eventually create collapse. This has always been true of civilizations. Ours has just globalized the stakes.

Given these dynamics, Schmachtenberger sees two default futures - two "attractors" that civilization naturally drifts toward.

The first is decentralized catastrophe. Powerful technology spreads to more actors. More people can do more damage. Coordination gets harder. Eventually something breaks badly enough that recovery isn't possible.

The second is centralized dystopia. To prevent that breakdown, surveillance and control systems expand. Power concentrates. Freedoms shrink. We avoid catastrophe by becoming a prison.

The question he poses: is there a third attractor? A way to coordinate well enough to prevent catastrophe, without concentrating power into tyranny?

## What Prediction Markets Solve

Prediction markets address one piece of this puzzle: our broken ability to agree on what's true.

When people can't agree on facts, they can't coordinate. Information ecosystems have become polluted - by propaganda, by algorithms optimizing for engagement, by tribal loyalty overriding evidence. Different groups operate from different realities. Cooperation becomes impossible because there's no shared ground to cooperate on.

Prediction markets help by making accuracy profitable. When you stake money on outcomes, being wrong gets expensive. The market aggregates information from many sources - private knowledge, expert judgment, on-the-ground observation - into probability signals. Ideological spin gets priced out.

This matters. Better shared understanding enables better collective decisions. If markets correctly price risks - climate, pandemic, political instability - people can respond to reality instead of narrative.

But prediction markets only solve half the problem. They tell us what's likely to happen.

They don't help us coordinate action to change it.

Think about the incentive: prediction markets reward people who correctly forecast events. They reward foresight, not intervention. A market can accurately predict disaster while doing nothing to prevent it.

The multipolar trap stays intact. We might all see the cliff coming with perfect clarity and still drive off it. Each actor, armed with accurate predictions, keeps optimizing for themselves in ways that hurt everyone.

Prediction markets are a mirror. They show us where we're headed. They don't change direction.

## What Coordination Markets Complete

Coordination markets (like @hyperstiti0ns) are the other side of the coin. Where prediction markets solve for knowledge, coordination markets solve for action.

Where prediction markets ask "what will happen?", coordination markets ask "what are we willing to make happen?"

The core shift: instead of rewarding accurate forecasts, coordination markets reward participants for contributing to outcomes. You don't just bet on whether something occurs—you help make it occur.

This changes the game theory that keeps us stuck in multipolar traps.

The classic trap: "I'd cooperate if I knew others would cooperate, but I can't be sure, so I don't." Uncertainty about what others will do makes going first irrational. Everyone waits. Nothing happens.

Coordination markets make commitment visible. When capital enters a position, it signals skin in the game. When enough people show stake, uncertainty resolves. The calculus flips - cooperation becomes the smart move once you can see enough others are cooperating too.

The market doesn't just predict whether coordination will happen. It creates the conditions where coordination becomes rational.

This addresses the problems Schmachtenberger identifies:

**Rivalrous dynamics** persist in normal prediction markets - I win, you lose. Coordination markets can be positive-sum. If the outcome we're coordinating toward creates real value - infrastructure, policy, public goods - everyone benefits from that value, not just from winning a bet. The thing we build together is worth more than the market itself.

**Multipolar traps** dissolve when commitment becomes observable. The problem isn't that people don't want to cooperate - it's that they can't trust others to cooperate at the same time. Markets that show visible, credible commitment resolve that uncertainty.

**Exponential technology** outpaced our coordination capacity. That's part of what created the metacrisis. Coordination markets are themselves a technology - one that scales our ability to act together, not just our ability to act. They could help close the gap between what we can do and what we can wisely coordinate.

## Two Sides of One Coin

Prediction markets and coordination markets aren't competing ideas.

They're two halves of a complete system.

Sensemaking without coordination means accurate despair: we see what's coming but can't act together to change it. Coordination without sensemaking means organized foolishness: we act together toward goals we've misjudged. Both failure modes are everywhere today. Movements that correctly diagnose problems but splinter before solving them. Movements that coordinate effectively toward the wrong ends.

A complete system needs both. Prediction markets to surface truth - what's real, what's likely, what leads to what. Coordination markets to convert shared understanding into shared action - showing commitment, resolving uncertainty, making cooperation rational.

One side tells us where we are. The other side moves us somewhere else.

Schmachtenberger's third attractor - coordination that prevents catastrophe without becoming tyranny - might need exactly this combination. The sensemaking layer resists capture because markets correct manipulated narratives. The coordination layer prevents catastrophe by actually producing collective action, not just forecasting problems.

Prediction and coordination. Knowledge and action. Sensemaking and commitment.

Two sides of the same coin - and both sides are needed to buy a future worth living in.
