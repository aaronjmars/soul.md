# I launched a memecoin: here is what I've learned.

**Nov 21, 2024**

I've been in this industry for the past four years. I've invested in +30 startups. I've worked with the biggest Web2 & Web3 IPs. Yet, I never launched a token nor a NFT myself. It was time to end this (and no, I won't drop a CA at the end of the post).

One of the leading narrative of this year is the debate around memecoins vs utility coins.

@MustStopMurad says it really well: "Utility tokens are just memecoins with extra steps". That's a very cool narrative you have there. But is it true ?

Are memecoins fairer than VC tokens ?

I've aped in a lot of memecoins and most of the time, team really sucks. Why ? What's hard about launching a token ? Well, I'm going to share what I've learned about the industry and the memecoin market.

To be honest, I did not launch a token (yet) - I've run a CTO with my team of +~10 members. I like the idea of CTO, to revive a dead token. You don't really get liability, you can find an already existing narrative, and you don't need to graduate from Pump. I think there are a lot of potential to do it, there are very good sleeping tokens.

We accumulated a good part (probably too much) of tokens for the CTO and started to create content, built a strategy to revive the community & tried to structure the team.

It took off really quick, going +100x in one day. Yikes, wtf.

We made a lot of mistakes, which I'll be very honest about.

**The first one is we did not take any fucking profit.** We had some idealistic vision of building a cult, going to +10M in the long run. The thing is, if marketing is a money game, memecoins are hardcore mode.

KOLs are not your friend and are not reliable at all. They call a token "new paradigm" and dump it in 30 minutes. Pump and dumps always end at the dump part.

And you quickly find out it's very similar to traditional advertising, where you get a CAC and a customer ROI. It's a PVP game where you fight your ad network and your users.

**In this game, if you are not taking profits, you are being farmed.** It's a pretty awful way to frame the industry, but it's true. It's you or them.

Speaking about community, it's very hard to build something reliable on this market. Attention spans are tiny and if you haven't shipped something in a day, people can sell at ~90% loss.

NFTs have a lot of flaws, but they really enabled community building. For sub-$10M memecoins, it's very hard.

Now, I view memecoins as the sandbox to build utility tokens (& build skills overall). You can become the best at content creation (FWOG or using @merv_wtf), community creation (Retardio) or Shill with KOLs (idk but a lot of tokens). But at the end of the day, you're going to build a product if you are successful.

It's also a great way to build a top-level team, because it's a high risk / high reward environment, with a lot of stress. I've been staggered by how stressful it can be, especially during pumps. And how depressing it can be, especially during dumps.

I've become amazed by memecoins & utility coins community that can keep building during these types of turmoils. Honestly, you gotta experience it to understand.

We've also seen how much Twitter sucks for crypto projects, but not sure if Farcaster fixes something there. Ultimately, the best memecoins are people with existing audiences pooling their social capital together.

Made me really excited about social DEXes / launchpads, making people accountable and diminishing the impact of bundling.

## Also think there are tons of opportunities to innovation in the space:

- Excited about Flaunch / Baseline and ways to earn with your LPs + give back volatility to users.

- Case study / documentation is fucking non-existent. Probably missed some articles, but did not find a single (good) article like mine on the internet, about memecoins & how to do a proper launch + manage community. We're early.

- There is a space for new models of VCs, market makers & products dedicated to manage memecoins. Because it's REALLY similar to a startup, your pre-seed buyers incur the most risks (but they are not locked).

- Pump really is a casino. You don't need Pump if you are a serious team. And you are missing on tons of revenue.

I don't know if I'm being an asshole trying to regulate / complexify something that doesn't need to. Yet I'm really convinced the space can be funnier & more accountable.

**Utility vs Memecoin debate is not rational.** I'd rather buy a token from a16z than a random dev that bundled 10 wallets at $5k MC. And until we haven't made this risk smaller, we can't really have fun, because it's a zero-sum game.

I like the vision of memecoins, building communities have never been that important and I do think they will succeed. But we need better tools to do so, and the VC model isn't that bad. I'd like to give early users a stake in my token, but I don't want them to flip it for a mere 10% after 1 day.

And I also think VC fund too much bullshit that will never earn money nor create a lasting community. So we probably need a hybrid model.

At the end of the day I think it's just community building where memecoin is an attention mechanism. Like Pudgy Penguin did. Or Milady.

And the best meme wins the Internet.

But I'm also wondering how useful community building really is, when you can automate the meme creation : textual (@truth_terminal / @luna_virtuals) or visually (@merv_wtf / @luna_virtuals).
