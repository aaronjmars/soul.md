# Borges, Slop, and the Crisis of Infinite Creation

*The Library of Babel and what it means for the future of creation.*

**Jan 07, 2026**

In 1941, Borges wrote a short story about an infinite library. The Library of Babel contains every possible book - every permutation of 410 pages using 25 orthographic symbols (Borges is spanish). Somewhere in its hexagonal rooms is a book explaining exactly how you'll die. Somewhere else is the same book with one typo. Somewhere else is 410 pages of the letter "a."

The librarians who live there went through phases. First: euphoria. Everything is written! The mysteries of existence are solved, filed somewhere in the stacks. Then: despair. Because for every true book there are billions of almost-true books, gibberish books, books that start coherent and collapse into noise on page 200. The librarians can't tell which is which. Some of them started burning books at random. Others just walked until they died.

Borges thought he was writing about God, or maybe about language, or about the impossibility of perfect knowledge. He was also writing about the internet in 2026. He just didn't know it.

## What Slop Actually Is

For most of history, making things cost something. Writing a book took years. A film required money and people. Even a photograph needed equipment. This meant that if something existed, someone had probably meant for it to exist. Not always. But often enough that you could assume intention behind artifacts.

LLMs broke this. The cost of producing text dropped to nearly zero. Same with images. Now everyone can generate the Library of Babel.

The output has a name: slop. AI-generated articles written for search engines, not readers. Synthetic images that fill feeds. Product descriptions, news summaries, social posts - all produced faster than any human could read them, let alone write them.

Slop isn't just bad content. Bad content has always existed. Slop is different. It's the industrial production of Borges's nonsense books - stuff that occupies space and matches patterns while meaning nothing to anyone. The hexagonal galleries, built for real.

## The Sorting Problem

Borges's librarians invented search methods. Some believed in a master book that would decode all others. Some became "Purifiers" and destroyed anything that looked like nonsense, though they couldn't be sure. Some wandered randomly and hoped.

We use algorithms. Google, recommendation engines, social feeds. These are our navigation systems. They're failing. Google now surfaces AI summaries of AI articles about AI content. Social platforms optimize for engagement, and slop can be engineered to engage. It mimics the shape of things people click on.

Here's the core problem: generating slop is cheaper than filtering it. Any system built to find signal can be gamed by producing noise that looks like signal.

The Library grows faster than we can search it.

## When Existence Proves Nothing

Before the Library existed, creation implied intention. If someone wrote something, they probably meant it. The artifact pointed backward to a mind. You could make inferences.

Slop breaks this. When creation is free, existence tells you nothing. A text might be the product of years of thinking or just a single prompt. The words don't point anywhere anymore.

This is exactly what Borges described. His librarians couldn't tell true Vindications from false ones that differed by a single comma. We can't tell an essay written from understanding from one that mimics the pattern of understanding while comprehending nothing.

So value moves. Not to creation but to provenance - can you trace where this came from? Not to content but to context - who vouches for it? Not to the text but to the author, and not to the author's words but to whether they've shown, over time, that they mean things.

## What Becomes Valuable

The old information economy organized around production. Publishers and platforms controlled what got made. The new one has to organize around selection. The Library already contains everything. The question is what to retrieve.

This means the valuable human activities are now curatorial. Taste. Judgment. The willingness to stake your name on a claim about what matters. These stay expensive because they require what slop can't provide: a perspective that persists, that can be wrong, that can be held accountable.

Borges got this too. His librarians dream of a "Man of the Book" - someone who has read the total book that synthesizes all the others. He would be like a god. In the slop economy, anyone who can reliably identify meaning in noise starts to resemble this figure. Not because they create. Because they select.

*(this might be AI written. or maybe not. who cares exactly)*
