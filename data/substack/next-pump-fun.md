*a.k.a what's the future of memecoins ?*

I've been monitoring extensively the space (I have mental issues) : https://x.com/aaronjmars/status/1841469254903677039

Also launched myself memecoins, bought +1000s different shitcoins on pump & worked with some launchpads.

Today I'm sharing my thoughts about the future of the memecoin industry & sharing some projects I find promising.

How's the market right now ? Well ... Pump dot fun is crushing everything.

The biggest updates around the platform have been around new type of content : livestreaming + videos, and better trading experience "pro". They haven't really been focused on changing the revenue system nor new AI features like most of their competitors - Virtuals @virtuals_io being the most successful.

Three of the most common critics they receive are : retaining too much value (fees + swap percentage), too many rugs and lazy / bad content.

## Lets see how some of their competitors tries to solve that...

### G8Keep - @g8_keep:

- Focused on sniper protection & safe liquidity
- Mix between linear distribution & launchpad
- Mechanisms are quite confusing to get, but very modular and tailored for any token
- Multichain EVM

### Baseline - @BaselineMarkets:

- They created a way to launch tokens backed by a floor liquidity, similar to what Olympus or Floor were / are doing.
- All tokens are minted from day one, no vesting schedule and supply is dynamic.
- Props to them, the platform is really intuitive and gamified. Afterburner is a buyback scheduled a few times a day, bumps are a way to raise the backing.
- Floor price is backed by raised money + fees from swap & more.

### Beliefs - @beliefssocial:

- Focused on content & community creation.
- X and Farcaster extension to curate & transform posts into memecoins.
- Built-in Farcaster social layer, including tips & airdrops for community participants.
- On Base, graduate to Uniswap @ 3 ETH of liquidity.

### Flaunch - @flaunchgg:

- 100% trading revenue share to devs & community
- They have a 'backing' mechanism that buys back the token with the trading fees. It's honestly awesome, favoring high volume tokens. You can also turn it off to let the dev pay for marketing or listing expenses.
- Dev gets a NFT when he launches a token. This NFT accrue the revenue and enable selling or fractionalization of community ownership. New use-case for NFTs, CTO made easier.
- Fair launch period where everyone ape at the same token price & can't sell for 30mn. Not sure if it's going to work, but def cool as a user to not get frontrun.

### Upside - @UpsideWTF:

- Content focused, you can pick tweets & vote for them.
- Built-in ownership, where you can claim back fees from your tweets.
- Upvoting system, feels like Reddit + Pump

### Zoo dot fun - @zoodotfun:

- Not a lot of infos, but made by Sudoswap founder so bullish
- Really think NFTs can become relevant again

### Flip dot meme - @flipdotmeme:

- NFT creation with AI, different pre-made styles with a controlNet
- Built-in royalties (which is missing on Pump)
- Bonding curves for NFTs
- Liquidity is collected to make bids on collections
