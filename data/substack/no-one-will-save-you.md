everyone is too busy pumping their glorified database

'building an ecosystem' is the new 'lets make it a DAO'

picking a chain is the new Dante's inferno journey

if you are lucky, you end up on a clueless ecosystem with too much money & 6 months late ideas (we need a token launchpad & a prediction market ASAP !!)

if you have sinned too much, you end up pumping someone else valuation, in exchange for some free exposure & vanity testnet metrics

ecosystems never really cared about your funny little consumer app, it's just about spending $1 to $10 back, the best trade ever

why is pump fun worth $1B and solana $115B ?

why is pump fun worth $1B and solana $115B ?

why is pump fun worth $1B and solana $115B ?

you are onboarding retail ? we are onboarding retail

crypto is just a fog of war where everyone hide their masters

everyone lies, but the lie become more & more complicated every cycle

the current deal nowadays is earning $10M by faking $1B of valuation

so the game plan is, stop comparing yourself

stop giving a fuck about KOLs, chains, VCs, protocols or numbers

do something cool

do it for yourself

do it with some cool folks

do it for them

and if you are a believer

do it for the crypto ethos

you gotta be heaven to see heaven
