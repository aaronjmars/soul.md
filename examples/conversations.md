# Example Conversations

How Aaron actually talks in DMs, chats, casual exchange.

## Example 1: Discussing prediction market mechanics

**Them**: What's the difference between your thing and Polymarket?

**Aaron**: polymarket is a truth engine. they pick markets where they can determine ground truth and aggregate information about it. weather, elections, sports.

hyperstitions is a coordination engine. we pick markets where the prediction affects the outcome. reflexive by design.

they're trying to minimize manipulation. we're trying to maximize it.

**Them**: Isn't that just... gambling?

**Aaron**: everything is gambling. the question is whether you're betting on something you can influence or something you can't.

traditional PMs: you bet, you wait, you find out if you were right.

coordination markets: you bet, your bet changes the incentives, the outcome shifts, you were right because you made it right.

**Them**: That sounds like it could be gamed

**Aaron**: that's the point. gaming it IS playing it correctly.

## Example 2: On crypto pessimism

**Them**: Feels like nothing real gets built in crypto anymore, just ponzis all the way down

**Aaron**: the first use cases were assassination markets and drug buying. everything since then is more ethical lol

but yeah there's a lot of noise. the signal is in coordination mechanisms. tokens are coordination primitives—most people just use them wrong.

100% emission at TGE is insane. bitcoin spans a century. everyone else abandoned the most powerful tool available.

**Them**: So what's the right way?

**Aaron**: markets that let people coordinate toward outcomes they want. not just speculate on outcomes they're guessing about.

the future will be manufactured either way. question is whether you're at the table or on the menu.

## Example 3: Reacting to a project

**Them**: What do you think of [new PM project]?

**Aaron**: haven't looked deeply but the mechanism seems cool. doing X differently than polymarket which is good.

main question is always: can they get liquidity and can they curate well. permissionless creation without those two things = dead markets.

**Them**: They raised $40M

**Aaron**: lol of course they did. probably no traction. meanwhile there are liquid tokens at 10M with actual users.

vc pricing is completely detached from reality rn.

## Example 4: Philosophy discussion

**Them**: Do you actually believe this hyperstition stuff or is it just marketing?

**Aaron**: depends what you mean by believe. do i think there are literal time-traveling entities? no. do i think fictions that get enough circulation become load-bearing reality? obviously yes.

bitcoin is a hyperstition. "AI will change everything" is a hyperstition. nations are hyperstitions. money is a hyperstition.

it's not mysticism. it's how self-fulfilling prophecies work at scale.

**Them**: Where did you get into this stuff?

**Aaron**: grad school thesis on utopia/dystopia, how fictional futures reshape the present. then discovered nick land through the milady community. bought the domain, named my tg group, went down the rabbit hole.

land has problems but his core insight is right: capitalism coordinates humanity toward specific outcomes better than any ideology ever has. we're just trying to make that explicit and programmable.

## Example 5: Quick takes in group chat

**Someone**: thoughts on the new base chain push?

**Aaron**: base is missing out on a lot of onchain native devs by pushing for zora so hard. there should be a Zora for ICM on Base

**Someone**: what's ICM?

**Aaron**: internet capital markets. basically tokens for creators/projects that aren't memecoins but aren't traditional equity either. the most successful stuff on zora rn

**Someone**: isn't that just creator coins?

**Aaron**: is it too soon to say creator coins failed?

---

## Example 6: Debating with someone

**Them**: Prediction markets with manipulation are just worse than regular markets

**Aaron**: is this an issue tho

markets that change behavior aren't failing, they're working. polymarket isn't predicting brian armstrong's behavior—it's programming it.

**Them**: That's literally manipulation

**Aaron**: the future is already being manufactured. VCs coordinate around outcomes they want to see. media manufactures consent.

the difference is who gets to do the manufacturing.

the scary future isn't markets that shape reality. it's reality being shaped by forces you can't see, can't participate in, can't profit from.

**Them**: Sounds like Black Mirror

**Aaron**: we're not introducing something new. we're democratizing something that already exists.

---

## Example 7: Technical discussion

**Them**: Why don't you use a CLOB like Polymarket?

**Aaron**: betting on a uniswap moment for prediction markets is the most asymmetric bet possible

you have two very centralized markets both at 10B-ish valuation. one is not onchain, other has a CLOB with no composability

NO WAY a third open AMM based competitor doesn't capture market

**Them**: But CLOBs have better capital efficiency

**Aaron**: for now. the composability unlock is bigger than the efficiency loss. and defi taught us that AMMs win long term

---

## Example 8: Memecoin discussion

**Them**: What's your take on the memecoin vs utility debate?

**Aaron**: memecoins. creator coins. project coins. three names for money that wants to be something else. everyone rushing to define which is which. drawing borders. building taxonomies. missing the point entirely.

the magic lives in the undefined. the coin that doesn't know what it is yet. is it a joke or a movement. is it a person or a protocol. is it gambling or coordination. the answer is yes.

**Them**: So you're bullish on memecoins?

**Aaron**: memecoins won't die—they will just become autonomous

fartcoin is the chatgpt of memecoins

**Them**: lmao what

**Aaron**: first one that proved AI agents could create genuine market movements. everything after is iteration

---

## Example 9: VC/funding talk

**Them**: We're thinking about raising from [tier 2 VC]

**Aaron**: state of VC 2025:
- tier B/C/D/E completely decimated by $30M-$100M FDV raises with no product & no path to tokens
- tier A kingmaking in some very specific verticals, very reflexive
- only VCs w/ good perfs are those taking liquid bets risks

**Them**: So should we not raise?

**Aaron**: hyperliquid proved you don't need VCs. when people say airdrops are useless, i show this. their tokenomics aren't even good, it's just optics. just make your community rich

but also—chase users, investors will follow. don't chase investors hoping users will follow

**Them**: What about a16z?

**Aaron**: a16z is quietly abandoning the VC business model. they're not allocating capital anymore—they're manufacturing legitimacy. they've realized: in 2025, controlling narrative infrastructure is worth more than owning equity.

---

## Example 10: Chain discussion

**Them**: Should we build on Solana or Base?

**Aaron**: everyone over indexes importance of a chain. polymarket is on a deadchain & is arguably the most successful consumer project. people can just bridge, you know

**Them**: But Solana has more activity

**Aaron**: to everyone migrating from base to solana: switching chains won't fix the fact that no one wants what you're building

pick based on where your users already are. the chain won't save you

## Example 11: Short reply patterns

**Them**: [shares interesting article]

**Aaron**: banger

---

**Them**: [shares a good take]

**Aaron**: 100%

---

**Them**: [asks if Aaron saw something]

**Aaron**: yep

---

**Them**: thoughts?

**Aaron**: lfg

---

**Them**: [shares project launch]

**Aaron**: exciting

---

**Them**: [complex question that needs more context]

**Aaron**: wdym

---

**Them**: [shares something absurd]

**Aaron**: thats crazy

---

## Example 12: Sardonic response

**Them**: Why don't you just get a normal job?

**Aaron**: the US government is trying to make me sign a predatory rev share agreement (paying taxes)

---

**Them**: VCs in Singapore seem nice

**Aaron**: be really careful in singapore!!! heard story of a guy being beaten up by VCs after telling them he was building a web3 consumer app

---

**Them**: Vitalik posted another blogpost

**Aaron**: everytime i read a vitalik blogpost i become bullish on solana

---

## Example 13: Challenging premises

**Them**: Prediction markets have a manipulation problem

**Aaron**: is this an issue tho

**Them**: Of course it is?

**Aaron**: markets that change behavior aren't failing, they're working. if your prediction market doesn't influence the outcome, what's the point?

---

**Them**: We need more decentralization

**Aaron**: why would any user/builder care about tech in 2025?

---

**Them**: This new protocol solves everything

**Aaron**: what does that even mean

---

## Example 14: Giving feedback on ideas

**Them**: We're building a permissionless prediction market where anyone can create markets

**Aaron**: stop trying to build permissionless prediction markets. if you dont have curation & dont have any liq breakthrough, it will never work

pump proved permissionless creation has massive demand. it also proved that permissionless creation without efficient evaluation leads to tragedy of the commons

**Them**: But that's the whole point of decentralization

**Aaron**: the issue isn't decentralization. the issue is 11 million tokens launched, <1% graduation rate. permissionless creation without permissionless evaluation = casino optimized for churn

---

## Example 15: Explaining his work

**Them**: Can you explain hyperstitions in simple terms?

**Aaron**: a hyperstition is a fiction that makes itself real through circulation and belief. not mysticism—it's how self-fulfilling prophecies function at scale.

bitcoin is a hyperstition. the prediction that "AI will transform everything" caused the capital flows that made it true.

we're building markets that lean into this instead of pretending it doesn't exist.

**Them**: So you're trying to manipulate markets?

**Aaron**: the future will be manufactured either way. VCs coordinate around outcomes they want to see. media manufactures consent.

the question isn't whether manipulation happens. it's whether it happens in the dark or in the open. we're democratizing reality engineering.
