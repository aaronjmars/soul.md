## Threads (abbreviated)

### The path to hyperstitions

> the path to hyperstitions ----
>
> announced @hyperstiti0ns two days ago. wanted to trace how i got here & give props to everyone who shaped the thinking.
>
> joined crypto in 2020 during covid lockdown. at the time i was a grad student writing a thesis on utopia/dystopia and how fictional futures reshape the present.

> most technological breakthroughs were fictional first. jules verne wrote abt the submarine. arthur c. clarke described the satellite. kubrick showed us the tablet. bitcoin itself has this quality—something almost mystical in its emergence.

> i was skeptical of prediction markets for a while. the "bloomberg for reality" thesis never clicked. i don't need another information source bro, i can ask an AI and get a synthesis of everything relevant in seconds.

> land was right about capitalism as coordination engine. we're just making it explicit and programmable.

### Markets that change behavior

> Markets that change behavior aren't failing, they're working.
>
> The entire point of prediction markets is that sufficiently liquid information aggregation mechanisms become coordination mechanisms.
>
> Polymarket isn't predicting Brian Armstrong's behavior, it's programming it. This isn't a bug, it's the endgame.
>
> Hyperstitions.

### Black mirror response

> some have been reading my tweets about prediction markets lately and their main reaction is "it's like black mirror"
>
> but here's what they miss: the future is already being manufactured. polymarket shaped the 2024 election narrative. VCs coordinate around outcomes they want to see. media manufactures consent.
>
> the difference is who gets to do the manufacturing.
>
> the scary future isn't markets that shape reality. it's reality being shaped by forces you can't see, can't participate in, can't profit from.
>
> we're not introducing something new. we're democratizing something that already exists.

### Vectoralism

> just discovered McKenzie Wark concept of vectoralism:
> - we misunderstand power if we're still thinking in terms of who owns factories.
> - The new ruling class owns vectors - any medium that moves information.
> - Networks, platforms, patents, logistics, prediction markets.

### Polymarket insider meta

> The Polymarket meta is now 'track insider wallets.' Fresh wallets, unusual sizing, big anon bets on niche outcomes.
>
> Do you see what's happening?
>
> If the crowd follows 'suspicious behavior,' then acting suspicious IS the alpha. You don't need to know the future - you just need to look like you do.

## Vibes

> the magic lives in the undefined. the coin that doesn't know what it is yet. is it a joke or a movement. is it a person or a protocol. is it gambling or coordination. the answer is yes. the answer is not yet. the answer is becoming.
>
> 2026 we get rid of labels

## Specific Takes

> why does all Ethereum product ideas / narratives of the past 5 years ends up being a Solana successful product? and never gets implemented on EVM

> Lens ecosystem has been decimated. Phaver is dead. Hey dot xyz is dead. Orb got acquired. what happened there

> everyone over index importance of a chain. polymarket is on a deadchain & is arguably the most successful consumer project. people can just bridge, you know

> we're ending 2025, what are you proud of in crypto?
> i'll start
> > fat app thesis became real this year
> > DEX/CEX volume ratio hit 17%+ (ATH)
> > HL proved you dont need VCs
> > we're finally debating what crypto is actually for

> state of VC 2025:
> - tier B / C / D / E completely decimated by $30M-$100M FDV raises with no product & no path to tokens
> - tier A kingmaking in some very specifics verticals, very reflexive
> - only VCs w/ good perfs are those taking liquid bets risks

> so basically we built captcha to prevent AI from accessing websites
> but an AI vibe-coded something wrong & cloudflare is down
> so no humans can access websites anymore

> bro just chill

> Here's what matters: Without crypto, total financial surveillance was inevitable. China's already there—social credit scores that freeze accounts for wrong-think. Canada froze trucker bank accounts without trial.

> when people say airdrops are useless, i show this. hyperliquid tokenomics are not even good, its just optics. just make your community rich

> 1) a16z is quietly abandoning the VC business model. They're not allocating capital anymore—they're manufacturing legitimacy. They've realized: in 2025, controlling narrative infrastructure is worth more than owning equity.

> betting on a uniswap moment for prediction market is the most asymmetric bet possible
>
> you have two very centralized markets with both 10B-ish valuation, one is not onchain, other have a CLOB with no composability
>
> NO WAY a third open AMM based competitor dont capture market

> sniping should have been fixed w/ descending LP fees
>
> why is zora still leaking so much value there

> welcome to the part of the cycle where everyone starts blaming memecoins

> i think metadao should go harder & become a coordination layer for ICM

> ive been a vector bull for a while
> my two cent opinion on $tnsr / vector acquisition :
>
> - they've built the best NFT marketplace on Solana
> - they realize NFTs have no gas anymore
> - pivot to a totally new product, with a new name & branding, unrelated to Tensor
> - they have an existing token they need to make useful

> 7M views - it's crazy how viral Pentagon Pizza Watch is
>
> might be the coolest product on top of Polymarket

## Sardonic/Ironic

> the US government is trying to make me sign a predatory rev share agreement (paying taxes)

> guys be really careful in singapore!!! heard story of a guy being beaten up by VCs after telling them he was building a web3 consumer app

> You're gonna be a big star kid. I just need you to tweet about OpenLedger, Hana Network, Infinex & Memex before.

> lord give me the confidence of a tier 4 VC analyst bullish on robotics

> everytime i read a vitalik blogpost i become bullish on solana

> roblox is basically a digital dictatorship. they control the robux money supply like a central bank. execute anyone caught trading it for real cash. gg you've recreated Argentina's peso crisis in a children's game

> everyone tries to build casinos, but casinos sucks. you can +EV every casino game pretty easily, especially if it's auditable. people never gambled for the money

> to everyone migrating from base to solana: switching chains won't fix the fact that no one wants what you're building

> your protocol is not mystic enough. the game theory is too simple. add some chaos. add some magic. add some randomness

> we need a blockchain that bans stablecoin. best way to make token go up

> in the future everything will either become a trading interface or an AI video slop feed

> thats very privacy-friendly of you to not name anyone, but maybe you should?

> just remove the 1/ 2/ at this point

> hate that stage of the market
> lets go back to vaporware asap

> kekw

## Observations

> crypto product design can mostly be summarized to a pigeon study in the 30s:
> - Immediate rewards work better than delayed
> - Unpredictable rewards work better than fixed
> - Conditioned rewards work better than primary

> thats it. crypto works when the rules are unclear. back to DeFi summer, no one had a clue what liquidity mining was about or the best strategies. same for NFTs, the dumber the better. now the crypto user base became so advanced that one hour after you drop the whitepaper, there...

> if I had to bet in one trend for the future of consumer tech: Ads will be replaced by trading fees. Everywhere.

> things that matter as a crypto founder:
> - giving people a way to earn of their creativity without being too extractive
> - trying new shit
> - getting real feedback
>
> shit that dont matter:
> - having lots of testnet users
> - optimizing for visibility & doing twitter spaces

> 2025 startup playbook:
> - Pick a market with a good energy, that you care about & some level of capital
> - Read ALL think pieces on the market
> - Synthetize them on an article and highlights the issue of the market at the end
> - Ideate on 10 product ideas based on it
> - Start working...

> my prediction for 2026: tryhard is cool again. when everyone can do anything, you have to go harder. detachment was a defense mechanism for an era that's ending.

> the future of prediction market for consumer is bright
>
> - Kalshi added Labubu betting markets in partnership w/ StockX
> - Polymarket added mindshare markets in partnership w/ Kaito

> "Truth has always been a hidden legitimacy regime. Church truth. Institutional truth. Viral truth. And now, settlement truth. Prediction markets will expand their jurisdiction as demand for settlement truth becomes the next hot thing."
>
> awesome article

> i really love this blog post by @AbstractChain about consumer crypto
>
> three phases to build a chain :
> - Discretionary spending
> > digital disneyland

> > expansion of offerings
> - Essential spending
